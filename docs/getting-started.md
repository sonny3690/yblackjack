## ✨ Writing Up-To-Date Docs

If you query **sections** of the *Reference Docs,* it’ll tell you if your codeblock is out of date or not.

+++section;query=;status=outdated;type=section;hash=;editable=false;title=

```
def what_is_this():
    print("This is an outdated codeblock 👴🏽")

```

+++

\

+++section;query=/class-Remap#Source Code;status=current;type=query;hash=9bf697f155e2bfaa1451;editable=false;title=

```
class Remap():
    """ Class for remapping annotation """
    def __init__(self, in_vcf, reference, out_vcf="/dev/stdout", min_length=50, threshold=0.8):
        """ The setup """
        ...

```

+++

\
Just hit `Query Section` and see the magic happen! Feel free to edit the query as much as you want, since it remembers what was originally queried 😸.
